Python implementation of the classical African board game, Mancala.

Good starting point for developing deeper artificial intelligence profiles.

Currently supports two basic AI profiles:
- one vector-based that optimizes for free turns & captures
- one simple random AI

To run tests (from inside project directory):
    `python -m unittest`
